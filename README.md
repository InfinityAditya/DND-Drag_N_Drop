🚀 Drag-n-Drop Machine Learning Environment
An innovative Scratch-like tool for building machine learning pipelines through an interactive drag-and-drop interface! Designed to simplify ML concepts for beginners and empower developers to experiment with machine learning workflows without writing complex code. 🌟

With built-in tutorials and pre-configured tools, this environment bridges the gap between visual programming and real-world machine learning!

🌟 Features
Interactive Drag-n-Drop Interface: Build ML workflows with ease using blocks.
Integrated Backend: Supports real-time model training and predictions via Flask APIs.
Customizable ML Pipelines: Easily modify the code blocks to extend functionality.
Built-in ML Models: Start with models like Linear Regression and expand as needed.
Beginner-Friendly: Includes step-by-step guides for learning ML concepts hands-on.
🔧 Tech Stack
Frontend: JavaScript + Blockly for drag-and-drop programming.
Backend: Python with Flask for managing ML operations.
Machine Learning: scikit-learn for training and predictions.
Data: Support for dummy data and real-world datasets.
Database: SQLite/MySQL for saving user pipelines and configurations.
🚀 Getting Started
Follow these steps to set up and run the project:

1️⃣ Prerequisites
Python 3.7+ installed
Node.js (optional for advanced frontend customizations)
2️⃣ Installation
Clone this repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/drag-n-drop-ml.git
cd drag-n-drop-ml
Install backend dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install flask scikit-learn
Launch the Flask server:

bash
Copy code
python app.py
Open the index.html file in your browser to start building!

📚 How It Works
🧱 Build Pipelines with Blocks
Drag and drop pre-defined blocks to create ML workflows:

Train Model: Train a model with example data.
Predict: Use trained models to make predictions.
🌐 Backend
The Flask backend handles:

Model training and serialization.
API endpoints for predictions.
🔍 Real-World Applications
Teach machine learning concepts in schools and colleges.
Prototype machine learning workflows without writing code.
Experiment with models and datasets interactively.
🌟 Roadmap
Planned features for future updates:

Support for Advanced Models: Add support for Decision Trees, SVMs, Neural Networks, etc.
Interactive Visualizations: Show real-time graphs of model performance.
Dataset Upload: Allow users to upload and process custom datasets.
Community Sharing: Save and share ML workflows with others.
